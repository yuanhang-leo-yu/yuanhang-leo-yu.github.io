    abstract: "Air pollution disperses across political boundaries, yet many environmental policies regulate specific polluted locations. This paper studies how cross-boundary transport of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) changes the welfare effect and design of pollutant control policy in China. Using particle trajectory data from atmospheric transport models, we construct bilateral flow matrices that measure the transboundary air pollution in China. Three patterns emerge: (1) Transboundary pollution is heterogeneous across space, ranging from less than to over of local concentrations; (2) Bilateral pollutant transport networks remain stable over time, enabling long-term policy coordination without frequent recalibration; and (3) Economically developed provinces in China receive more transboundary pollution yet achieve larger pollution reduction. We develop a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model that incorporates pollutant transport, trade, and migration. Using this model, we estimate that transboundary air pollution creates a national welfare loss relative to a counterfactual where pollution remains local. We evaluate China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan and compare it to alternative allocation rules. Reallocating abatement to high-spillover upwind provinces based on marginal social welfare of emission tax improves aggregate welfare by relative to the actual policy. The findings reveal welfare gains from accounting for spatial externalities in policy design."

    abstract: Education and labor mobility are key drivers in the production of human capital, fundamental to economic development. In the U.S., the varying skill production efficiencies of state-specific education systems and the dynamics of worker migration shape human capital of states, influencing economic outcomes at both the state and national levels. This paper develops a novel dynamic spatial general equilibrium model with overlapping generation framework in which heterogeneous individuals accumulate human capital and move across states. Calibrated to the U.S. economy, the model illustrates how variations in education efficiency lead to substantial cross-state income disparities and shows that internal migration can notably boost output in states with lower education efficiencies. At the national level, free mobility of workers yields a 6.9% output gain. Moreover, the model suggests that variations in human capital account for 46.6% of the state variation per capita output. Applying the calibrated model to analyze the Obama Administration's Race to the Top initiative finds that the $4.1 billion grant spurred a 0.2% increase in U.S. GDP, mostly benefiting the grant-winning states and their neighbors. Additionally, alternative grant allocation experiments show that strategic reallocation of education grants, considering state skill production efficiencies, could further increase national GDP gains without necessarily worsening state income disparities.
