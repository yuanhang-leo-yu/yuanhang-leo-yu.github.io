    abstract: "Air pollution disperses across political boundaries, yet many environmental policies regulate specific polluted locations. This paper studies how cross-boundary transport of fine particulate matter ( PM_2.5 ) changes the welfare effect and design of pollutant control policy in China. Using particle trajectory data from atmospheric transport models, we construct bilateral flow matrices that measure the transboundary air pollution in China. Three patterns emerge: (1) Transboundary pollution is heterogeneous across space, ranging from less than 10% to over 50% of local PM_2.5 concentrations; (2) Bilateral pollutant transport networks remain stable over time, enabling long-term policy coordination without frequent recalibration; and (3) Economically developed provinces in China receive more transboundary pollution yet achieve larger pollution reduction. We develop a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model that incorporates pollutant transport, trade, and migration. Using this model, we estimate that transboundary air pollution creates a 1% national welfare loss relative to a counterfactual where pollution remains local. We evaluate China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan and compare it to alternative allocation rules. Reallocating abatement to high-spillover upwind provinces based on marginal social welfare of emission tax improves aggregate welfare by 0.18% relative to the actual policy. The findings reveal welfare gains from accounting for spatial externalities in policy design."

  # abstract: Many economic shocks affect not only workers’ wages and employment but also health. We study their mechanism, welfare effects, and policy implications in a dynamic quantitative model with endogenous health investment. The health production technology is flexible, allowing workers to optimally choose to forego or partially treat sickness, or incur non-medical health investment. Applying this model to the China shock, we estimate its causal effects on health and calibrate the model to the pre-China shock economy. Our simulations suggest that, first, the health investment mechanism is economically significant, with the model elasticity accounting for between 40-50% of the empirical estimates. Second, the workers’ steady-state welfare loss is equivalent to an annual drop of 8.4% in consumption, and both endogenous health investment and health itself play important roles. Finally, while universal health insurance is effective in reducing partial or foregone treatment, it offers little protection for non-medical investment. Therefore, its overall efficacy would be nuanced.

  # abstract: "We investigate how reduced in-person school days affect educational inequality through parental responses. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation in school-level in-person days and a linked administrative–survey panel, we find that each ten-day loss increases household tutoring expenditure by 4 percent and within-school test-score dispersion by 25 percent. We build and estimate a household choice model where formal schooling and tutoring jointly generate test scores. Estimates suggest tutoring substitutes for in-person days and that closures burden low-income households disproportionately. Counterfactual simulations show that a means-tested tutoring-voucher program matches the overall inequality reduction of a universal scheme while cutting costs by 20 percent."

  # abstract: This paper explores the effect of two different types of land use policies on regional economies by using regional level data of South Korea. We analyze the effect of conventional land-use restrictions in existing cities as well as the effect of unique land-supply policies, motivated by the South Korean government’s 2nd New Town Project which built new cities from the scratch, supplying 666,000 houses near Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). We estimate the effect of such policies on the aggregate and regional economies, considering both the efficiency gain from the resource reallocation and externalities from regional decline. If the government introduces tighter land-use restrictions in SMA and relaxes land-use restrictions in other regions, regional population will more evenly distribute at the cost of aggregate GDP loss and universal housing price increases. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the 2nd New Town Project was cost effective as it permanently increased steady state real aggregate GDP flow by 0.4%, for the one-time cost amounting 4.05% of GDP. It however exacerbated regional decline by decreasing overall rural population share by 4%.
