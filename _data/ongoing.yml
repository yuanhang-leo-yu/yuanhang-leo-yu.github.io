    abstract: "Air pollution disperses across political boundaries, yet many environmental policies regulate specific polluted locations. This paper studies how cross-boundary transport of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) changes the welfare effect and design of pollutant control policy in China. Using particle trajectory data from atmospheric transport models, we construct bilateral flow matrices that measure the transboundary air pollution in China. Three patterns emerge: (1) Transboundary pollution is heterogeneous across space, ranging from less than 10% to over 50% of local PM2.5 concentrations; (2) Bilateral pollutant transport networks remain stable over time, enabling long-term policy coordination without frequent recalibration; and (3) Economically developed provinces in China receive more transboundary pollution yet achieve larger pollution reduction. We develop a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model that incorporates pollutant transport, trade, and migration. Using this model, we estimate that transboundary air pollution creates a 1% national welfare loss relative to a counterfactual where pollution remains local. We evaluate China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan and compare it to alternative allocation rules. Reallocating abatement to high-spillover upwind provinces based on marginal social welfare of emission tax improves aggregate welfare by 0.18% relative to the actual policy. The findings reveal welfare gains from accounting for spatial externalities in policy design."

    abstract: "This paper investigates whether and how trade shock impacts the gender employment gap in economies with large informal sectors. Leveraging regional variations in exposure to import tariff reductions during Brazil's 1990s trade liberalization, I find that female employment declines significantly in both medium and long terms, while male employment remains unchanged in the medium term but rises in the long term, widening the male-female employment gap in both periods. To better understand employment dynamics, I decompose the overall changes in employment into formal and informal sectors. In the formal sector, women face larger job losses than men, while in the informal sector, female employment remains largely unaffected and male employment rises. These empirical findings suggest that while trade shocks contract formal employment for both genders, the expanded informal sector serves as an employment buffer primarily for male workers. Further exploration of the mechanisms reveals that occupational segregation and child-care responsibilities limit women's ability to use informal employment as a buffer against job loss. These findings demonstrate how informality, gender-based sectoral sorting, and childcare constraints amplify gender inequality under trade liberalization."

  # abstract: "We investigate how reduced in-person school days affect educational inequality through parental responses. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation in school-level in-person days and a linked administrative–survey panel, we find that each ten-day loss increases household tutoring expenditure by 4 percent and within-school test-score dispersion by 25 percent. We build and estimate a household choice model where formal schooling and tutoring jointly generate test scores. Estimates suggest tutoring substitutes for in-person days and that closures burden low-income households disproportionately. Counterfactual simulations show that a means-tested tutoring-voucher program matches the overall inequality reduction of a universal scheme while cutting costs by 20 percent."

  # abstract: This paper explores the effect of two different types of land use policies on regional economies by using regional level data of South Korea. We analyze the effect of conventional land-use restrictions in existing cities as well as the effect of unique land-supply policies, motivated by the South Korean government’s 2nd New Town Project which built new cities from the scratch, supplying 666,000 houses near Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). We estimate the effect of such policies on the aggregate and regional economies, considering both the efficiency gain from the resource reallocation and externalities from regional decline. If the government introduces tighter land-use restrictions in SMA and relaxes land-use restrictions in other regions, regional population will more evenly distribute at the cost of aggregate GDP loss and universal housing price increases. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the 2nd New Town Project was cost effective as it permanently increased steady state real aggregate GDP flow by 0.4%, for the one-time cost amounting 4.05% of GDP. It however exacerbated regional decline by decreasing overall rural population share by 4%.
